# Tumblr-Feed  

**Tumblr** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).  

üìù `NOTE - PASTE PART 2 SNIPPET HERE:` Paste the README template for part 2 of this assignment here at the top. This will show a history of your development process, which users stories you completed and how your app looked and functioned at each step.  


## Tumblr Part 1

The following **required** user stories are complete:  

  - [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

## Notes
